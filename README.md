# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python" 

## Project Overview

Unemployment is a critical economic indicator, and its analysis can provide valuable insights, especially during periods of significant changes like the Covid-19 pandemic. This data science project focuses on analyzing India's unemployment rate during the pandemic using Python. By utilizing various data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of unemployment trends and their implications.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing information about India's unemployment rate. The dataset is sourced from: [Unemployment Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/unemployment.csv)

## Analysis Techniques

The project employs several Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

- **Pandas and NumPy**: Data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly Express**: Generating interactive visualizations.
- **Statsmodels**: Performing time series analysis and forecasting.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and renaming columns.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
3. Time Series Analysis: Analyzing the trend and seasonality in the unemployment rate over time.
4. Comparative Analysis: Comparing unemployment rates across different regions and states.
5. Employment vs. Unemployment: Exploring the relationship between employment and unemployment.
6. Cluster Analysis: Grouping states based on unemployment and labor participation rates.
7. Time Series Forecasting: Forecasting future unemployment rates using time series models.
